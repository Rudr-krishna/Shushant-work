  about: `I'm a writer with a passion for exploring the human condition through different narrative forms. My work spans short stories, screenplays, and feature film concepts, each designed to immerse readers and viewers in worlds both familiar and strange.

  My writing focuses on character-driven narratives that examine the complexities of human relationships, identity, and the subtle moments that shape our lives. I'm particularly drawn to stories that blend genres and challenge conventional storytelling formats.

  When I'm not writing, you'll find me exploring independent cinemas, playing chess, or engaging in conversations about narrative theory and the evolving landscape of storytelling.`,
